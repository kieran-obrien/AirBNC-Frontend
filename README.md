# AirBNC - Backend

## Overview

#### AirBNC is my capstone project for the Northcoders Software Development with Javascript course.

A fullstack web application, it showcases all the skills I learned over the course of the bootcamp. It aims to recreate the experience of the popular property rental site [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk).

# AirBNC - Frontend

## Overview

#### AirBNC is my capstone project for the Northcoders Software Development with JavaScript course.

A fullstack web application, it showcases all the skills I learned over the course of the bootcamp. It aims to recreate the experience of the popular property rental site [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk).

This repo is for the Frontend portion of the project and is built using React.js, Tailwind CSS and Vite.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

#### Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v22.15.0 or higher)

## Local Install

- Clone the repo down locally:
  `git clone`
- Move to project directory: `cd AirBNC-Frontend`
- Install dependencies:`npm i`

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Working with Dev Server

To run a local development server using Vite:
`npm run dev`

The dev server will allow you to interact with the app on your local network.

### This project is currently in development so this README will update as the project progresses.
